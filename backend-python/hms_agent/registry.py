"""Canonical tool registry.

The single source of truth for what the agent can invoke.

The defect this replaces: `/tools/call` passes a client-supplied string to
`getattr(agent, tool_name)` (orchestrator_agent.py:~190), so the reachable
surface is *every public method on every registered agent* — which is how
`delete_patient` stays callable despite having no `@mcp.tool` registration.

Here a client string is only ever used as a **dictionary key**. It never reaches
`getattr`. Adding a method to an agent therefore grants no new capability; a
binding must be declared below, and it must also have a policy entry, or the
registry refuses to start.
