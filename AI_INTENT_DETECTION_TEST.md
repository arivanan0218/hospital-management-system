## ðŸ¤– Intelligent AI Intent Detection Testing

### Natural Language Examples That Should Work:

**Patient Creation:**
- "I need to register a new patient"
- "Can you help me add a patient named John Smith?"
- "I want to admit someone"
- "Register a patient please"
- "Add new patient to the system"

**Staff Addition:**
- "I need to hire a new doctor"
- "Add a nurse to our team"
- "Register new employee"
- "I want to add staff member"

**Department Creation:**
- "Create cardiology department"
- "We need a new department for surgery"
- "Add department"
- "Set up new department"

**Equipment Addition:**
- "Add new MRI machine"
- "Register medical equipment"
- "I need to add equipment"

**Appointment Booking:**
- "Schedule a meeting with doctor"
- "Book appointment for patient"
- "I need to make an appointment"

**Room/Bed Management:**
- "Add new room to the hospital"
- "Register a bed"
- "Create new room"

**Information Requests (Should Use AI Processing, Not Forms):**
- "Show me all patients"
- "List departments"
- "Find patient John Smith"
- "What appointments do we have today?"
- "Check bed availability"

### How It Works:

1. **AI First**: Uses OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo to analyze user intent
2. **Smart Detection**: Recognizes creation vs information requests
3. **Fallback**: Uses keyword matching if AI detection fails
4. **Natural Language**: Works with conversational, natural requests

### Benefits:

- âœ… More natural conversation
- âœ… Works with any phrasing
- âœ… Intelligent context understanding
- âœ… Graceful fallback to keywords
- âœ… Better user experience
