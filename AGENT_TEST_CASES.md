'Test transaction rollback scenarios: simulate failures during multi-agent operations, verify proper rollback across all affected agents, ensure no partial data corruption'

'Validate referential integrity: create complex data relationships across agents, delete parent records, verify cascade operations, maintain database consistency'

'Test concurrent data modifications: multiple users modifying same patient record, implement proper locking, prevent data conflicts, maintain data accuracy'

// Expected Response Pattern: /integrity.*maintained|consistency.*verified|conflicts.*resolved/i
```

## SECURITY AND COMPLIANCE TEST SCENARIOS

### Access Control Testing
```javascript
// Test Case Group 66: Security Validation
'Test role-based access control: verify physicians can access patient records, nurses have appropriate permissions, administrative staff have limited clinical access, unauthorized users are blocked'

'Validate audit trail completeness: every data modification logged with user, timestamp, before/after values, maintain complete audit trail for regulatory compliance'

'Test data encryption: verify patient data encrypted at rest and in transit, secure password storage, encrypted backups, compliance with HIPAA requirements'

// Expected Response Pattern: /access.*controlled|audit.*complete|encryption.*verified/i
```

### Regulatory Compliance Testing
```javascript
// Test Case Group 67: Compliance Validation
'Validate HIPAA compliance: patient data access logging, minimum necessary standard enforcement, breach notification procedures, compliance reporting capabilities'

'Test Joint Commission requirements: medical record completeness, medication reconciliation processes, patient safety protocols, quality measure tracking'

'Verify state and federal regulations: controlled substance tracking, mandatory reporting procedures, license verification, regulatory audit trail maintenance'

// Expected Response Pattern: /compliance.*verified|regulations.*met|standards.*maintained/i
```

## AUTOMATION AND CONTINUOUS TESTING

### Automated Test Execution Framework
```python
# Example Test Automation Structure
class HospitalManagementSystemTests:
    
    def setUp(self):
        """Initialize test environment and sample data"""
        self.orchestrator = OrchestratorAgent()
        self.sample_patients = generate_test_patients(100)
        self.sample_staff = generate_test_staff(50)
        self.test_database = create_test_database()
    
    def tearDown(self):
        """Clean up test environment"""

## TEST EXECUTION METHODOLOGY

### Test Environment Setup
1. **Isolated Test Database**: Complete copy of production schema with synthetic test data
2. **Agent Service Instances**: Dedicated test instances of all 11 agents
3. **Mock External Services**: Simulated email services, file systems, external APIs
4. **Monitoring and Logging**: Comprehensive logging for test analysis and debugging
5. **Data Reset Procedures**: Automated cleanup and reset between test runs

### Test Data Management
- **Realistic Sample Data**: 1000+ synthetic patients, 100+ staff members, complete department structure
- **Edge Case Scenarios**: Data variations to test boundary conditions and error handling
- **Performance Test Data**: High-volume datasets for load and stress testing
- **Security Test Data**: Various user roles and permission scenarios

### Test Execution Strategy
- **Automated Daily Runs**: Complete test suite execution every night
- **Continuous Integration**: Tests run on every code commit
- **Manual Exploratory Testing**: Human testing for usability and edge cases
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Regular performance baseline validation
- **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability and penetration testing
