## 🛠️ **FRONTEND FORMATTING IMPROVEMENTS APPLIED**

### ✅ **Issues Fixed:**

1. **JSON Data Display** - Filtered out raw JSON from workflow messages
2. **Staff Display** - Shows names instead of IDs (Dr. Sarah Anderson vs staff_id)  
3. **Bed Display** - Shows bed numbers instead of UUIDs (Bed 101D vs bed_id)
4. **Clean Workflow Summary** - User-friendly messages instead of technical logs

### 🎯 **What Your Users Will Now See:**

**Instead of:**
```
📝 Workflow Log:
• Equipment assigned: ECG Monitor 003, ECG Monitor 008, ECG Monitor 009
• Admission reports generated: {"patient_id":"9ba58e95-ca81-4c91...}
• 🎉 Admission process completed successfully - patient ready for care!
```

**They'll see:**
```
🛏️ Bed Assignment: ✅ Bed 101D
👥 Staff Assignment: ✅ 2 medical staff assigned
   • Primary Doctor: Dr. Sarah Anderson
   • Primary Nurse: John Miller
⚙️ Equipment Setup: ✅ 3 items assigned
