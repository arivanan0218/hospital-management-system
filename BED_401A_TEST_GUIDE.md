🏥 BED 401A STATUS TEST GUIDE
═══════════════════════════════

✅ **BACKEND STATUS**: Working perfectly!
✅ **CURRENT BED 401A STATUS**:
   - Current Status: cleaning
   - Process Status: cleaning  
   - Time Remaining: 23 minutes
   - Progress: 23.3%

🎯 **WHAT TO TEST IN FRONTEND**:
1. Open http://localhost:3000 in browser
2. Try these exact queries:
   
   📝 "check bed 401A status"
   📝 "what is the status of bed 401A"  
   📝 "bed 401A cleaning status"
   📝 "how much time remaining for bed 401A cleaning"

🔍 **EXPECTED FRONTEND RESPONSE**:
```
🛏️ Bed 401A Status:
🧽 STATUS: CLEANING IN PROGRESS
⏱️ Time Remaining: 23 minutes
📊 Progress: 23.3%
💡 The bed is currently being cleaned and will be ready in 23 minutes.
```

❌ **IF YOU SEE THIS INSTEAD**:
"The status of bed 401A is currently available..."
OR
"It seems there was a misunderstanding in the query..."

📋 **THEN THE ISSUE IS**:
- Frontend message parsing is not detecting bed status queries
- OR frontend is not calling get_bed_status_with_time_remaining
- OR frontend formatting is not working

🔧 **FRONTEND TROUBLESHOOTING**:
1. Open browser developer console (F12)
2. Check for any JavaScript errors
3. Try the query and see what network requests are made
4. Check if the bed status tool is being called

✅ **VERIFICATION**: 
The backend changes have been made:
- ✅ Backend now accepts bed numbers (not just UUIDs)
- ✅ Backend returns proper cleaning status
- ✅ Frontend extraction pattern updated
- ✅ Frontend formatting code exists

🚀 **NEXT STEPS**:
Test the frontend at http://localhost:3000 with the queries above!
