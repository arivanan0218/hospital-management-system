```

### 2. Container/Server Deployment

### 3. Post-Deployment Testing

- [ ] Room dropdown shows options
- [ ] Meeting scheduling works
- [ ] Email notifications sent
- [ ] Google Meet links generated

## 🧪 Quick Tests

### Test Room Dropdown:
1. Open frontend
2. Say "create bed"
3. Verify room dropdown shows rooms
4. Should see: "Room 301 (private) - Floor N/A"

### Test Meeting with Emails:
1. Say "schedule meeting with all staff"
2. Provide meeting details
3. Should see: "✅ Email notifications sent to all staff"

### Test API Endpoints:

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"params": {"name": "list_rooms", "arguments": {}}}'
```
